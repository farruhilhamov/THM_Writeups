The Attacker's Perspective

There are several ways in which an attacker can move laterally. The simplest way would be to use standard administrative protocols like WinRM, RDP, VNC or SSH to connect to other machines around the network. This approach can be used to emulate regular users' behaviours somewhat as long as some coherence is maintained when planning where to connect with what account. While a user from IT connecting to the web server via RDP might be usual and go under the radar, care must be taken not to attempt suspicious connections (e.g. why is the local admin user connecting to the DEV-001-PC from the Marketing-PC?).

Attackers nowadays also have other methods of moving laterally while making it somewhat more challenging for the blue team to detect what is happening effectively. While no technique should be considered infallible, we can at least attempt to be as silent as possible. In the following tasks, we will look at some of the most common lateral movement techniques available.


Administrators and UAC

While performing most of the lateral movement techniques introduced throughout the room, we will mainly use administrator credentials. While one might expect that every single administrator account would serve the same purpose, a distinction has to be made between two types of administrators:

    Local accounts part of the local Administrators group
    Domain accounts part of the local Administrators group

The differences we are interested in are restrictions imposed by User Account Control (UAC) over local administrators (except for the default Administrator account). By default, local administrators won't be able to remotely connect to a machine and perform administrative tasks unless using an interactive session through RDP. Windows will deny any administrative task requested via RPC, SMB or WinRM since such administrators will be logged in with a filtered medium integrity token, preventing the account from doing privileged actions. The only local account that will get full privileges is the default Administrator account.

Domain accounts with local administration privileges won't be subject to the same treatment and will be logged in with full administrative privileges.

This security feature can be disabled if desired, and sometimes you will find no difference between local and domain accounts in the administrator's group. Still, it's essential to keep in mind that should some of the lateral movement techniques fail, it might be due to using a non-default local administrator where UAC is enforced. You can read more details about this security feature here.


Psexec

    Ports: 445/TCP (SMB)
    Required Group Memberships: Administrators

Psexec has been the go-to method when needing to execute processes remotely for years. It allows an administrator user to run commands remotely on any PC where he has access. Psexec is one of many Sysinternals Tools and can be downloaded here.
